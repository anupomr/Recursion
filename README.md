# Recursion
Java Program 

Exercise 1
Create a recursive algorithm to compute the product of two positive integers, m and n, using only addition and subtraction. Implement the Java or Python code. Hint: You need subtraction to count down from m or n and addition to do the arithmetic needed to get the right answer.

Exercise 2
Write a short recursive Java method that determines if a string s is a palindrome, that is, it is equal to its reverse. Examples of palindromes include 'racecar' and 'gohangasalamiimalasagnahog'. Test the method by asking the user to provide string entries to be checked. Hint: Check the equality of the first and last characters and recur (but be careful to return the correct value for both odd- and even-length strings).
